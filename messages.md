# artThings Message Structure

artThings is based around MQTT messaging where each message contains two parts. First a hierarchical message *topic*, use for publish and subscribe. Second a message *payload*. artThings defines standards for both the message topics and payloads. These standards are intended to enable different artworks to communicate. They can be extended to suit a particular use.
